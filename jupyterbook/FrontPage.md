width: 150mm
name: seafloor age mapped to equispaced points in the ocean

_Sample images created with `stripy` illustrating the meshing capability: ocean age data can be triangulated on the sphere with no need for points on land. Once `stripy` ingests your data points, you can sample another dataset to your grid (bathymetry on the right), smooth, find the derivatives of your data, or interpolate to another set of points._
